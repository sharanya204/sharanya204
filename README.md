I'm Sharanya; UX enthusiast and builder of things. 

I have a background in design, fluency in a variety of back end and front end development paradigms, and I'm passionate about engineering engaging experiences.

Sometimes I draw comics about archaic medical practices, and playing Counterfactuals brings me much joy. 

I'm also an extremely ardent climber of rocks.
